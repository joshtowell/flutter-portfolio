# Personal Flutter Portfolio

The aim of this project was to develop a central location for my online presence in the form of a [digital portfolio](https://joshuatowell.tech/). This begun with design processes in Figma, with the front and backend being developed in Flutter/Dart. My experience from Mobile application development brought the necessary skills required to start this project. I aim to continually update this project with infomation relating to my career and digital quests, as well as creating and implenting the latest and greatest designs!
